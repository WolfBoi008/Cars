# Archipelago Manual - Cars

## Notes
- I might create a Story Mode version, but the current idea is just free racing and similar features, similar to the Crash Team Racing Manual.
- If you don't have a complete save file for the game, you'll need a few Cheat Codes:
  - IF900HP - Unlock all mini-games
  - MATTL66 - Unlock all tracks
  - R4MONE - Unlock all characters
  - YAYCARS - Unlock all cars
- Even if you have a complete save file, you'll still need to use the Cheat Code TRGTEXC to unlock Materâ€™s Speedy Circuit and Countdown Cleanup once you are given the Bonus Games Password Item.
- If any version differences don't work due to me playing/making this Manual on the Wii, please let me know!
